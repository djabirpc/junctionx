Differences of opinion exist as to the circumstances in which the \"context ... object and purpose\" of the treaty may be used to supplement the \"ordinary meaning\" of the treaty. Inherent in this debate is the question of whether the textual interpretation of the words, embodied in the phrase \"ordinary meaning\", should be afforded interpretative precedence. Some commentators have argued that the literal meaning has no precedence and that the object of the treaty must always be taken into account [O'Connell, International Law, 2nd ed (1970), vol 1, p 253]; some have argued that the two general levels of inquiry embodied in par 1 of Art 31 have a single combined operation [Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, 4th ed (1990), p 628; Ris, \"Treaty Interpretation and ICJ Recourse to Travaux Pr&eacute;paratoires: Towards a Proposed Amendment of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:, Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review, vol 14(1) (1991) 111]; and some have argued that words and phrases of a treaty are in the first instance to be construed according to their plain and natural meaning and that it is only when the result of such an inquiry is doubtful that one should look to a treaty's context, object and purpose [Shearer, Starke's International Law, 11th ed (1994), pp 435-436]. Australian decisions provide no clear answer as to whether Art 31 requires or merely allows recourse to the context, object and purpose of a treaty in interpreting one of its terms. It is clear that such recourse is, in some circumstances, permissible. On numerous occasions, Australian courts have sought to discern the purpose of a treaty so as to construe a treaty term [Koowarta [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 265-266; Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 21 FCR 122 at 160; Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379 at 413; SS Pharmaceutical v Qantas [1991] 1 Lloyd's Rep 288 at 295-299]. What is not clear from the decided cases, however, are the circumstances which require or allow recourse to the context, object and purpose of a treaty. Nor have those cases clarified the nature of the relationship between the context, object and purpose of a treaty and the 'ordinary' textual analysis of one of its provisions.'\n",

            " . Treaties often fail to demonstrate the precision of domestic legislation and should thus not be applied with \"taut logical precision\".'\n",
            "71 DAPFI submitted that the Commissioner's submissions depart from an application of these principles in two material respects:\n",
            " \n",
            "(a) They seek to confine reference to the 'context, object and purpose' to that of the Treaty as a whole, and to avoid reference to those considerations in interpretation 'of the treaty provisions'. Considerations of context and purpose are equally relevant to the interpretation of the various articles of a treaty, the course followed in McDermott at [40] and following; and\n",
            " \n",
            "(b) they are a fine example of the application of 'taut logical precision' to construction of the Treaty, not merely giving its words 'primacy' but largely excluding context and purpose.\n",
            "72 A consideration of the interrelationship of the provisions of the Treaty (and other treaties following the same basic model) shows a concern with the substantive nature of the amounts over which the treaties allocate taxing rights (see for example the preference for economic substance over legal form in the conceptions of 'permanent establishment', 'business profits' and 'real estate'). Business profits, which are allocated to the taxing power of the country to which they are most closely economically connected, do not include amounts which are in substance investment income, whether rent, interest, dividends or royalties (Art 7(6)), and investment income is categorised according to the substantive (rather than the formal) rules of the domestic law. Articles 10(4), (6) and (7), 11(5), (9) and (10) and 12(4) and (5) illustrate this concern.\n",
            "73 It would be an odd outcome that Art 11(9)(a), a provision whose origin manifestly lies in a purpose of confining Art 11 to what in substance regardless of its form is interest on a loan, should be so construed as to exclude from the Article an amount which in substance though not in form is interest. Such a result would seem to be contrary to the 'context object and purpose' of the provision.\n",
            "75 When regard is had (as properly it should, McDermott at [41]) to the history of the provisions, it is apparent that Art 11(9)(a) served the purpose of protecting US objectives, but no material purpose in the protection of Australian taxes. Amounts 'in the nature of interest' which were (or were deemed to be) distributions on shares were for treaty purposes allocated to Art 10, as 'income from shares' (Art 10(6)), which might be subjected to withholding tax at 15%, and were excluded from Art 1l by the concluding words of Art 11(5); but Australia in any event limited its withholding tax on such amounts to 10%, treating them as the yield on debt interests. Article 11(9)(a) thus had no relevant role to play in an Australian context, and while it was as the Commissioner says 'a power allocated to each Treaty country', its construction is more illuminated by the purpose which as a matter of agreement, inserted 'as the necessary price paid for international political comity' ( Applicant A at 256) it served in US tax policy than by reference to Australian tax provisions.\n",
            "76 DAPFI submitted that the Commissioner also seeks support in the 'actual text' of the Treaty, but does so without regard to the whole of the text. In looking to the 'four corners of the actual text', one construes the text in the light of its purpose; as McHugh J said in Applicant A at 253, 'the ordinary meaning of the words are not to be determined in a vacuum removed from the context of the treaty or its object or purpose'. If the words are consistent with that purpose, the construction should serve to fulfill it, not to frustrate it.\n",
            "77 So when reading Art 11(5), while it is accurate as a matter of taut logical precision to say (see the Commissioner's submissions at [47] above) that it applies to 'any payment which is treated as interest under domestic law, regardless of legal form':\n",
            " \n",
            "(a) To do so would not be consistent with the purpose of the provision, and\n",
            " \n",
            "(b) it would be inaccurate to say that the Treaty recognises no difference between what is in legal form interest and what is in substance interest: the words 'as well as', which for the purpose of the Treaty add to interest on 'securities bonds and debentures' what is 'subjected to the same taxation treatment' as interest, clearly acknowledge two categories of payments formal and substantive 'interest' as being within the operation of the Article.\n",
            " \n",
            "In this context, the role of Art 11(9)(a) is to exclude what substantively is not interest from its scope: that is, what in form is interest but in substance is profit share. The text of Article 11(9)(a) bears this out: it deals with payments 'determined with reference to profits', a qualifier appropriate to what in form is framed as interest rather than profit share.\n",

            "117 As to the Commissioner's second contention, the absence of express provision for apportionment in Art 11(9)(a) is not an exclusion or prohibition of an apportionment. A global sum payable under a contract may be apportioned where the commercial reality is that only part of the payment can be regarded as being determined with reference to profits; the apportionment should be done on the basis of a realistic estimate on sensible commercial grounds (cf., Roadshow Distributors Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue [1998] 1 VR 523 at 529). This approach is all the more appropriate in the case of a treaty, which should not be construed in a narrow technical way.\n",
            "118 Here the commercial reality is that the whole payment was an indirect receipt of the interest paid by CBA, and so was interest calculated without regard to any substantive 'profit' calculation. But insofar as there is a calculation with reference to profits, only part of the payment is so calculated, because what is payable includes a basic interest amount identified in the formula, and the apportionment can be readily done in view of the way the distributions were calculated.\n",
            "119 For my part, I cannot accept the proposition that the 'commercial reality' (whatever that means, but presumably a synonym for 'economic substance') is that the whole payment (the distribution from Industrie LP to DAPFI) was an indirect receipt of the interest paid by CBA. For a start, Industrie LP was not a mere interposed conduit between CBA and DAPFI. Indeed, Industrie LP did not lend to CBA; it invested the whole of its funds in another NSW limited partnership, Luca LP: see [11] above. And even Luca LP did not lend the whole of its funds to CBA; $2 million was lent at interest to other financial institutions.\n",

        " INTRODUCTION\n",
        "\n",
        "1 There are two applications before the Court.\n",
        "The first (NSD 226 of 2007) is an application for declaratory relief in the form of a declaration that certain distributions from a limited partnership established under the laws of New South Wales ('Industrie LP') to the applicant ('DAPFI') are not subject to withholding tax; alternatively, a declaration that, to the extent of a substantial part of such distributions, they are not subject to withholding tax.\n",
        "The second (NSD 227 of 2007) is by way of an appeal against the decision of the respondent ('the Commissioner') disallowing an objection against the Commissioner's Notice of Private Ruling (Authorisation Number 61512), ruling, inter alia , that DAPFI will not be exempt from withholding tax in respect of such distributions under Art 11(3)(b) of The Convention between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income , as amended by the Protocol ('the Treaty') in Schedules 2 and 2A to the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 (Cth) by reason of the provisions of Art 11(9)(a) of the Treaty ('the private ruling').\n",
        "In short, both applications raise the same issue.\n",
        "2 At the commencement of the hearing, Senior Counsel for DAPFI explained that there are two proceedings because at the time they were instituted (16 February 2007), there existed the unfavourable notice of private ruling (dated 4 April 2006) which related to what was then future liability to withholding tax.\n",
        "By virtue of s 359-60(3)(b) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth), no objection can be made against a private ruling if it relates to withholding tax that has become due and payable.\n",
        "The declaratory proceedings were instituted to agitate the issue in respect of withholding tax that had already been paid by the time both proceedings were instituted, that is, for the quarters ended 31 December 2005, 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December 2006; and an amended application filed 22 August 2007 encompassed the quarters ended 31 March and 30 June 2007 as well.\n",
        "3 It was further explained that since the institution of proceedings, payments to which the private ruling would apply have ceased to be made, so that although the Court is seized with jurisdiction in relation to the private ruling objection decision, the private ruling will have no ongoing application after the determination of these proceedings.\n",
        "4 Evidence was filed and read in the declaratory proceedings, but there is no factual issue in dispute.\n",
        "In the appeal against the private ruling, there is no evidence apart from the documents forwarded to the Court under O 52B r 5A of the Federal Court Rules .\n",
        "The evidence filed in the declaratory proceedings goes to two matters.\n",
        "The first is the establishment of the partnership and the creation of the obligations to make the payments in respect of which withholding tax is claimed, and the second goes to DAPFI's reliance on a public ruling issued by the Commissioner, namely, Taxation Ruling TR2005/5 dated 16 March 2005 ('the public ruling'), in particular, para (10) of the public ruling.\n",
        "Senior Counsel for DAPFI informed me that there was no issue between the parties as to reliance.\n",
        "Certainly Senior Counsel for the Commissioner did not suggest that there was.\n",
        "There is, however, an issue between the parties as to whether the reliance was misplaced; that is, as to whether the public ruling says what DAPFI believed it to say.\n",
        "THE FACTUAL CONTEXT\n",
        "\n",
        "5 The relevant corporate/financing structure is depicted in a diagram which is Annexure 1 to the private ruling application.\n",
        "It assists an understanding of the narrative that follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6 DAPFI is a company incorporated and controlled in Delaware, USA, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG.\n",
        "It is not a resident of Australia for income tax purposes and has no permanent establishment in Australia at or through which it carries on any activities.\n",
        "It is common ground (Ruling 2 of the private ruling) that DAPFI is a 'United States corporation' and a resident and enterprise of the United States for the purposes of the Treaty, and entitled to the benefit of the Treaty under Article 16.\n",
        "7 DAPFI was established with an issued capital of $US154 million, and borrowed from Deutsche Bank AG a further $A800 million, to participate in the transaction that is the subject of these proceedings and other financing transactions.\n",
        "8 DAPFI became a limited partner in Industrie LP, a limited partnership established under NSW law.\n",
        "The general partner of Industrie LP was CBA Investments Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Commonwealth Bank of Australia ('CBA').\n",
        "CBA was also a limited partner.\n",
        "9 The capital of Industrie LP comprised $A998 million contributed by DAPFI (for a Redeemable Limited Partner Interest (US) ('RLPI(US)'), $A282.707 million contributed for a Redeemable Limited Partner Interest (and $1,000 for a non-redeemable limited interest) held by CBA, and $A11 million contributed by the general partner.\n",
        "The limited partnership interests are 'debt interests' for the purposes of Div 974 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ('the 1997 Act').\n",
        "10 For Australian tax purposes, Industrie LP is a wholly owned subsidiary of CBA and\n",
        "is treated as part of the CBA consolidated group (under Part 3-90 of the 1997 Act).\n",
        "11 Industrie LP invested the whole of its funds in Luca LP, a NSW limited partnership, as a general partner.\n",
        "DAPFI invested $2 million in Luca LP as a limited partner.\n",
        "Another Deutsche Bank subsidiary invested $1,000 in Luca LP as a general partner.\n",
        "Luca LP applied the whole of its funds to making advances to CBA at interest, save for $2 million lent at interest to other financial institutions.\n",
        "12 Luca LP received interest income on its investments.\n",
        "Luca LP was treated as a company for Australian tax purposes (Div 5A of Pt III of the - ('the 1936 Act')) and paid tax at the rate of 30%.\n",
        "It distributed its after tax income to Industrie LP and DAPFI as general and limited partners respectively.\n",
        "13 Under the terms of the Industrie Limited Partnership Deed dated 24 August 2005, as amended by amending deed dated 7 September 2005, the entitlement of DAPFI to annual receipts of income was to so much of the 'Adjusted Net Income' of each year as equalled the 'RLPI(US) Distribution Amount' for the year, subject to a proviso that if the Adjusted Net Income differed from the total of the RLPI(US) Distribution Amount and the GPI Distribution Amount payable to the general partners, the excess or shortfall should be shared pro-rata.\n",
        "14 The 'RLPI(US) Distribution Amount' was calculated by multiplying DAPFI's capital contribution by the 'Agreed Rate,' which was Reuters BBSW less a stipulated spread.\n",
        "15 Relevantly, cl 10.1 of the Partnership Deed, as amended, provided:\n",
        " '10.1 Allocation of Adjusted Net Income of Partnership If the Adjusted Net Income is a positive amount, the Partners (other than the Non-Redeemable Limited Partner and the RLPI (Aus) Limited Partner) will be entitled to the Adjusted Net Income in respect of each Allocation Period as follows:\n",

        "22 By s 94L, the distribution is deemed to be a dividend, but by s 6(1) and s 974-20 it is a deemed dividend on a non-equity share; it is in consequence required by s 128A(1AB)(d) of the 1936 Act to be treated for withholding tax purposes as 'interest.\n",

        "40 If the distributions are to be treated as a share of partnership profits, then since DAPFI is a United States enterprise with no Australian permanent establishment, Art 7 applies to them and DAPFI is relieved of Australian tax by s 4(2) of the International Tax Agreements Act .\n",

        "44 The central question in these proceedings is whether the distributions which DAPFI received from the Industrie LP fell within Art 11(9)(a) of the Treaty.\n",
        "45 It is common ground that those distributions were subject to withholding tax, subject to the operation of the Treaty: see [23] above.\n",
        "It is also common ground that unless Art 11(9)(a) applied, DAPFI was entitled to the benefit of the 'financial institution' exemption contained in Art 11(3)(b) of the Treaty.\n",
        "46 Article 11 allocates taxing rights between the country of residence and the country of source in respect of 'interest'.\n",
        "The 'interest' to which the Article applies is defined in broad terms in Art 11(5): see [26] above.\n",
        "47 As the emphasised words at [26] demonstrate, Art 11 applies to any payment which is treated as interest under domestic law, regardless of the legal form which that payment takes.\n",
        "The distinction between payments which are interest as a matter of 'form' and those which are interest as a matter of 'substance', which distinction is central to DAPFI's case, may immediately be seen to be a distinction not recognised by the Treaty.\n",
        "48 Each of Australia and the USA has also reserved to itself the right to tax certain 'interest' income at a higher rate in the two circumstances stated in Art 11(9)(a) and (b).\n",
        "This case is concerned only with the reservation in Art 11 (9)(a).\n",
        "49 By its terms, Art 11(9) applies to interest which is otherwise covered by Art 11(3)(b).\n",
        "It also applies (by reason of Art 11(5)) to payments which are treated as interest under domestic law.\n",
        "50 DAPFI nevertheless submitted that Art 11(9)(a) applies only to a certain category of interest, namely 'legal form' interest.\n",
        "The bases for this argument are:\n",
        "\n",
        "(a) the 'role' of Art 11(9)(a) having regard to the US domestic law policy which is said to lie behind it; and\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "52 As DAPFI's submissions demonstrated, the origins of Art 11(9)(a) lie in domestic US policy considerations.\n",
        "Those domestic policy considerations are different to Australian domestic policy considerations and, so the argument goes, Art 11(9)(a) should be read down to apply only to those payments which would appear to offend US policy.\n",

        "Those principles permit the object and purpose of a treaty to be considered in construing it, where necessary.\n",
        "55 The operation of a treaty may be informed by the object and purpose for which it was entered into.\n",
        "Here, the object and purpose of the Treaty was to eliminate double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion.\n",
        "One of the methods by which that object and purpose is achieved is by the Treaty allocating to each country the right to tax certain payments of interest at rates specified by the Treaty (in the case of Art 11(9) at a rate not exceeding 15%).\n",
        "56 However, there would appear to be no need to refer to the object and purpose of the Treaty in construing Art 11(9)(a).\n",
        "The text of the Treaty is in this respect not open to doubt.\n",
        "Article 11 in terms plainly applies to 'interest' such as that in question here (namely a dividend which is treated as interest under domestic legislation: Art 11(5)).\n",
        "Furthermore, and for the same reason, Art 11(9) applies irrespective of the form of the payment in question.\n",
        "57 The Commissioner submitted there is thus no ambiguity in the text of the Treaty to be resolved by reference to the object and purpose of the provision.\n",
        "To the extent that any doubt is perceived about the scope of Art 11(9)(a), the object and purpose of the Treaty provides no basis for the submission advanced by DAPFI.\n",
        "Australian v US Policy Considerations\n",
        "\n",
        "58 DAPFI placed heavy emphasis on the proposition that the policy of taxing 'contingent interest' paid to non-residents as dividends is a peculiarly US policy.\n",
        "The Commissioner accepts that the origin of Art 11(9)(a) is, as it plainly appears to be, in the US law concerns outlined in DAPFI's submissions.\n",
        "59 Nevertheless, it cannot be assumed that the only concern of the Treaty countries in agreeing on Art 11 (9)(a) was to protect US domestic interests in that or any other respect.\n",
        "Had that been the only concern, there would have been a far clearer statement to that effect in the Treaty and, at the very least, some indication in the secondary materials.\n",
        "60 The more immediate policy concerns in agreeing to Art 11(9)(a) were inevitably the more familiar concerns common to all double-taxation treaties, namely to prevent double taxation and at the same time to protect Australia's taxing rights as far as possible.\n",
        "On any view, the resulting Art 11(9)(a) was a clause by which both countries agreed to abide.\n",
        "61 Article 11(9)(a) does not merely 'protect' US domestic provisions nor is it 'linked' to them: DAPFI's submissions at [31] and [33] above.\n",
        "Nor is it correct to say that it is 'directed' only to a US mischief: DAPFI's submissions at [32] above.\n",
        "It is rather 'directed' to allocating a taxing right to Australia in the same terms as the taxing right insisted upon (no doubt) by the US.\n",
        "Alleged inconsistency\n",
        "\n",
        "62 DAPFI's submission that the Commissioner is acting inconsistently ([38] --- [41] above) is without any foundation.\n",
        "63 Division 974 of the 1997 Act contains a set of rules and definitions in relation to the treatment of certain interests as either debt or equity interests.\n",
        "It contains no operative provisions.\n",
        "Instead, depending on the manner in which an interest is classified under Div 974, the Act elsewhere operates to treat that interest accordingly.\n",
        "64 Division 974 does not 'deem' interests (or payments) to be debt or equity for all purposes, nor even for all purposes of the Act.\n",
        "An interest is only treated in the manner prescribed by Div 974 to the extent the Act otherwise provides in its operative provisions.\n",
        "It is therefore wrong to assume that a payment in respect of a dividend which is 'deemed' to be 'interest' on a 'loan' by reason of Div 974 should be so treated for all purposes of the Act and for all the purposes of the Treaty.\n",
        "Properly construed, there is no inconsistency between Div 974 and Art 11(9)(a).\n",
        "Article 11(9)(a) continues to treat the payment as interest, it merely taxes it at a different rate.\n",
        "65 To the extent DAPFI relies on the 'deeming' effect of the provisions of Div 974, it is important to note that those 'deeming' provisions should be construed 'strictly and only for the purpose for which they are resorted to': Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Comber (1986) 10 FCR 88 at 96; East Finchley Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 20 ATR 1623 at 1643.\n",
        "66 The Commissioner submitted there is no basis to permit the perceived legislative policy of the 'deeming' provisions of Div 974 to derogate from the clear operation of Art 11(9).\n",

        "Specifically, it is argued that the Art 11(9)(a) only applies where the payment in question is made by an identifiable 'issuer'.\n",
        "68 The Commissioner submitted that there is little difficulty in concluding that DAPFI's interest in the Industrie LP was 'issued' by the Industrie LP.\n",
        "The term 'issuer' is not a term of art --- it merely identifies the entity (here, Industrie LP) whose profits by reference to which the payments in question (here, the distributions to DAPFI) are determined.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "71 DAPFI submitted that the Commissioner's submissions depart from an application of these principles in two material respects:\n",
        "\n",
        "(a) They seek to confine reference to the 'context, object and purpose' to that of the Treaty as a whole, and to avoid reference to those considerations in interpretation 'of the treaty provisions'.\n",
        "Considerations of context and purpose are equally relevant to the interpretation of the various articles of a treaty, the course followed in McDermott at [40] and following; and\n",
        "\n",
        "(b) they are a fine example of the application of 'taut logical precision' to construction of the Treaty, not merely giving its words 'primacy' but largely excluding context and purpose.\n",
        "72 A consideration of the interrelationship of the provisions of the Treaty (and other treaties following the same basic model) shows a concern with the substantive nature of the amounts over which the treaties allocate taxing rights (see for example the preference for economic substance over legal form in the conceptions of 'permanent establishment', 'business profits' and 'real estate').\n",
        "Business profits, which are allocated to the taxing power of the country to which they are most closely economically connected, do not include amounts which are in substance investment income, whether rent, interest, dividends or royalties (Art 7(6)), and investment income is categorised according to the substantive (rather than the formal) rules of the domestic law.\n",
        "Articles 10(4), (6) and (7), 11(5), (9) and (10) and 12(4) and (5) illustrate this concern.\n",
        "73 It would be an odd outcome that Art 11(9)(a), a provision whose origin manifestly lies in a purpose of confining Art 11 to what in substance regardless of its form is interest on a loan, should be so construed as to exclude from the Article an amount which in substance though not in form is interest.\n",
        "Such a result would seem to be contrary to the 'context object and purpose' of the provision.\n",
        "74 DAPFI submitted that the Commissioner's argument seeks to elude this oddity by focussing on an absence of express nomination of the purpose of the paragraph in the Treaty or the 'secondary materials'.\n",
        "But none of the treaties (nor the OECD or US models) contains express statements of this nature, in relation to any of their provisions; and while Australian secondary materials make no express reference to the purpose of the paragraph (the provision not having been included at its instance), the US secondary materials do.\n",
        "75 When regard is had (as properly it should, McDermott at [41]) to the history of the provisions, it is apparent that Art 11(9)(a) served the purpose of protecting US objectives, but no material purpose in the protection of Australian taxes.\n",
        "Amounts 'in the nature of interest' which were (or were deemed to be) distributions on shares were for treaty purposes allocated to Art 10, as 'income from shares' (Art 10(6)), which might be subjected to withholding tax at 15%, and were excluded from Art 1l by the concluding words of Art 11(5); but Australia in any event limited its withholding tax on such amounts to 10%, treating them as the yield on debt interests.\n",
        "Article 11(9)(a) thus had no relevant role to play in an Australian context, and while it was as the Commissioner says 'a power allocated to each Treaty country', its construction is more illuminated by the purpose which --- as a matter of agreement, inserted 'as the necessary price paid for international political comity' ( Applicant A at 256) --- it served in US tax policy than by reference to Australian tax provisions.\n",
        "76 DAPFI submitted that the Commissioner also seeks support in the 'actual text' of the Treaty, but does so without regard to the whole of the text.\n",
        "In looking to the 'four corners of the actual text', one construes the text in the light of its purpose; as McHugh J said in Applicant A at 253, 'the ordinary meaning of the words are not to be determined in a vacuum removed from the context of the treaty or its object or purpose'.\n",
        "If the words are consistent with that purpose, the construction should serve to fulfill it, not to frustrate it.\n",
        "77 So when reading Art 11(5), while it is accurate as a matter of taut logical precision to say (see the Commissioner's submissions at [47] above) that it applies to 'any payment which is treated as interest under domestic law, regardless of legal form':\n",
        "\n",
        "(a) To do so would not be consistent with the purpose of the provision, and\n",
        "\n",
        "(b) it would be inaccurate to say that the Treaty recognises no difference between what is in legal form interest and what is in substance interest: the words 'as well as', which for the purpose of the Treaty add to interest on 'securities bonds and debentures' what is 'subjected to the same taxation treatment' as interest, clearly acknowledge two categories of payments --- formal and substantive 'interest' --- as being within the operation of the Article.\n",
        "In this context, the role of Art 11(9)(a) is to exclude what substantively is not interest from its scope: that is, what in form is interest but in substance is profit share.\n",
        "The text of Article 11(9)(a) bears this out: it deals with payments 'determined with reference to profits', a qualifier appropriate to what in form is framed as interest rather than profit share.\n",
        "78 Nothing in the text of the Treaty conflicts with the approach to its construction which is indicated by reference to the matters of context and purpose on which DAPFI relies.\n",
        "Rather, the text supports that approach.\n",
        "79 On that approach, the payments to DAPFI --- which as a matter both of calculation and of economic substance (as indicated by the Commissioner's reliance on Div 974 to impose tax on them) are in the nature of interest --- fall properly within Art 10 of the Treaty.\n",
        "If regard were to be had only to legal form, and not to substance or deeming provisions, they would fall within Art 7.\n",
        "ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION ON THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 11(9) OF THE TREATY\n",
        "\n",
        "80 The course of DAPFI's argument that Art 11(9)(a) of the Treaty does not apply to the distributions it receives from Industrie LP in the present case may be paraphrased in the following way:\n",
        "\n",
        "(1) Accepting that Art 11(9) was included in the Treaty at the instigation of the United States to give effect to a particular US domestic law policy manifest in identified provisions of the IRC, the first step is to identify the mischief to which these provisions were directed.\n",
        "(2) The mischief so identified sets the parameters of the interest to which Art 11(9), in this case Art 11(9)(a), applies: it only applies to amounts 'dressed up' as interest (what is referred to as interest in form only) but which in substance are a division of profits; it does not apply to what is in substance interest albeit in form a division of profits.\n",
        "(3) To construe Art 11(9)(a) otherwise would give rise to an odd outcome; Art 11(9)(a), a provision whose origin manifestly lies in a purpose of confining Art 11 to what in substance regardless of its form is interest on a loan, should be so construed as to exclude from the Article an amount which in substance though not in form is interest.\n",
        "Such a result would seem to be contrary to the 'context, object and purpose' of the provision.\n",
        "81 The principal difficulty I have with the course of this argument is the point from which it starts.\n",
        "While the domestic law policy of a contracting State may explain the existence, and be reflected in the terms, of a provision of a treaty which it negotiates with another contracting State, that policy cannot control the construction and application of the provision as such, particularly where, as here, the other contracting State has no equivalent policy.\n",
        "In the case of Art 11(9)(a) of the Treaty, the United States reserved to itself the right to tax 'interest' paid by a resident of the United States, being interest to which a resident of Australia is beneficially entitled in the circumstances of Art 11(9)(a); not, it should be noted, in the circumstances of the domestic law policy manifest in the relevant provisions of the IRC which actuated or drove the reservation.\n",
        "Moreover, the United States also conceded an equivalent taxing right to Australia.\n",
        "The construction and application of that taxing right cannot be controlled by US domestic policy if the text in context --- the 'four corners of the actual text' --- points to a different construction.\n",
        "It is to that matter I now turn.\n",
        "82 Under the principles of interpretation referred to, the 'four corners of the actual text' must be given primacy in the interpretation process: see [70] above.\n",
        "So far as the proper construction and application of Art 11(9)(a) is concerned, the 'four corners of the actual text' extend to the whole of Art 11, and any other article of the Treaty that is drawn into the 'four corners of the actual text' expressly, or by implication.\n",
        "This is particularly relevant in relation to the term 'interest'; its definition in Art 11(5) is prefaced as being '... in this Article ...'; consequently, its scope and ambit is uniform throughout the whole of Art 11 and there is no limitation on the term other than what is to be found in Art 11(5) itself.\n",
        "One such limitation is: 'Income dealt with in Article 10 (Dividends) ... shall not be regarded as interest for the purposes of this Article'.\n",
        "Relevantly, the term 'dividends' as used in Art 10 is defined in Art 10(6) (see [25] above) to mean '... income from shares, as well as other amounts which are subjected to the same income tax treatment as income from shares by the law of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purpose of its tax '.\n",
        "The emphasised words correspond with the emphasised words in Art 11(5) (see [26] above) '... as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the law of the Contracting State in which the income arises ', and together provide both a dichotomy and a common boundary between amounts to which Art 11 applies and amounts to which Art 10 applies.\n",
        "That boundary neither contemplates nor accommodates a distinction between interest in form only and interest in substance (but not in form); the only relevant criterion for the application of Art 11 including Art 11(9), rather than Art 10, is whether the income is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the law of Australia.\n",
        "It is common ground that the income in the present case is so treated: see [22] above.\n",
        "83 So far as context is concerned, it is unlikely that context, in the present case, adds anything to the 'four corners of the actual text' as framed in [82] above.\n",
        "84 Turning to object and purpose, Art 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the Vienna Convention), referred to in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 265 per Brennan J (as he then was) as the 'leading and general rule of the interpretation of treaties', provides:\n",

        "A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n",
        "'\n",
        "85 In Applicant A 190 CLR at 253, McHugh J, after referring to what was said by Brennan J in Koowarta 153 CLR, said:\n",
        " 'Commentators differ as to the correct interpretation of Art 31.\n",
        "Differences of opinion exist as to the circumstances in which the \"context ... object and purpose\" of the treaty may be used to supplement the \"ordinary meaning\" of the treaty.\n",
        "Inherent in this debate is the question of whether the textual interpretation of the words, embodied in the phrase \"ordinary meaning\", should be afforded interpretative precedence.\n",
        "Some commentators have argued that the literal meaning has no precedence and that the object of the treaty must always be taken into account [O'Connell, International Law, 2nd ed (1970), vol 1, p 253]; some have argued that the two general levels of inquiry embodied in par 1 of Art 31 have a single combined operation [Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, 4th ed (1990), p 628; Ris, \"Treaty Interpretation and ICJ Recourse to Travaux Pr&eacute;paratoires: Towards a Proposed Amendment of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:, Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review, vol 14(1) (1991) 111]; and some have argued that words and phrases of a treaty are in the first instance to be construed according to their plain and natural meaning and that it is only when the result of such an inquiry is doubtful that one should look to a treaty's context, object and purpose [Shearer, Starke's International Law, 11th ed (1994), pp 435-436].\n",
        "Australian decisions provide no clear answer as to whether Art 31 requires or merely allows recourse to the context, object and purpose of a treaty in interpreting one of its terms.\n",
        "It is clear that such recourse is, in some circumstances, permissible.\n",
        "On numerous occasions, Australian courts have sought to discern the purpose of a treaty so as to construe a treaty term [Koowarta [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 265-266; Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 21 FCR 122 at 160; Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379 at 413; SS Pharmaceutical v Qantas [1991] 1 Lloyd's Rep 288 at 295-299].\n",
        "What is not clear from the decided cases, however, are the circumstances which require or allow recourse to the context, object and purpose of a treaty.\n",

        " 'Third, the mandatory requirement that courts look to the context, object and purpose of treaty provisions as well as the text is consistent with the general principle that international instruments should be interpreted in a more liberal manner than would be adopted if the court was required to construe exclusively domestic legislation [Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co A/asia Pty Ltd [1980] HCA 51 ; (1980) 147 CLR 142 at 159, per Mason and Wilson JJ; Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379 at 412-413; per Gaudron J; Buchanan &amp; Co v Babco Ltd [1978] AC 141 at 152].\n",
        "'\n",
        "87 And finally, at 256, his Honour said:\n",
        " 'Accordingly, in my opinion, Art 31 of the Vienna Convention requires the courts of this country when faced with a question of treaty interpretation to examine both the \"ordinary meaning\" and the \"context ... object and purpose\" of a treaty.\n",
        "'\n",
        "88 As the Commissioner submitted at [55] above, here the object and purpose of the Treaty was to eliminate double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion.\n",
        "It did this by allocating, or denying, to each contracting State taxing rights over different items of income --- business profits, dividends, interest and royalties to mention some --- in different circumstances.\n",
        "In this respect, the object and purpose of the different provisions of the Treaty 'piggy-back' the object and purpose of the Treaty itself.\n",
        "Relevantly, in the case of 'interest' as defined in Art 11(5), it denied each contracting State the right to tax 'interest' arising in that State to which a resident of the other State is beneficially entitled in the circumstances of Art 11(3)(b) but, by way of override, allocated to each contracting State the right to tax 'interest' (albeit at no more than 15%), that is paid by a resident of that State to which a resident of the other State is beneficially entitled in the circumstances of Art 11(9)(a).\n",
        "89 In my view, so approached, there is no inherent tension between the 'four corners of the actual text' and the object and purpose of Article 11(9)(a) of the Treaty.\n",
        "In these circumstances, the 'four corners of the actual text' must be given the primacy demanded by the principles of interpretation to which reference has been made.\n",
        "90 So predicated, that is, that the distributions to DAPFI fit the description of 'interest' for the purposes of Art 11(9)(a) of the Treaty, the remaining issue is whether they fit the description of 'interest ... that is determined with reference to the profits of the issuer'.\n",
        "Having regard to the form and terms of cl 10.1 of the Partnership Deed, as amended, in particular the provisos in (i) and (ii) where 'the Adjusted Net Income is a positive amount', there is no doubt, in my mind, that such distributions fit the description of 'interest that is determined with reference to the profits of' the limited partnership, Industrie LP.\n",
        "Contrary to the submissions of DAPFI, I have no difficulty in regarding Industrie LP as an 'issuer' for this purpose.\n",
        "Juridically, a partnership, even a limited partnership, is not a legal entity, but for Australia's domestic tax law purposes, a limited partnership such as Industrie LP is deemed to be one, a company (s 94J of the 1936 Act), and a partner's interest therein as a share in the notional company (s 94P of the 1936 Act).\n",
        "The concept of the notional company being an 'issuer' in respect of the notional shareholder's (s 94Q of the 1936 Act) notional share in the notional company involves no quantum leap.\n",
        "91 It follows, in my view, that Art 11(9)(a) of the Treaty applies to the distributions from Industrie LP to DAPFI so as to override the denial of the right to tax under Art 11(3)(b) of the Treaty.\n",

        " DAFPI's Submissions\n",
        "\n",
        "102 In order for interest to be determined with reference to profits, the quantum of the interest payable must be calculated with reference to profits, e.g.\n",
        "interest in an amount equal to a percentage of profits.\n",
        "This reflects the mischief to which Art 11(9)(a) is directed.\n",
        "It should be distinguished from interest the quantum of which is calculated by the application of a commercial rate to a principal sum where the interest is payable only out of net profit of the debtor or where the creditor is limited to particular funds (e.g.\n",
        "profits) or assets for payment of the interest.\n",
        "In these cases, the creditor's recourse for payment is limited to profits or assets of the debtor but the quantum of the interest is not determined by reference to those profits or assets --- they merely limit the liability of the debtor for payment of the interest.\n",
        "103 The 'RLPI (US) Distribution Amount' is a payment of 'interest' calculated by the application of a commercial rate to the amount of capital contributed.\n",
        "The mere fact that the obligation of the Industrie LP to pay that 'interest' is subject to the contingency that there is sufficient Adjusted Net Income does not mean that it is 'interest ... determined with reference to the profits' of Industrie LP --- the Adjusted Net Income is merely the source from which it is to be paid.\n",
        "The Commissioner's Submissions\n",
        "\n",
        "104 The Commissioner submitted that there is no basis upon which this alternative relief is available.\n",
        "The whole of the distribution to DAPFI was required by the terms of the Partnership Deed, as amended, to be determined with reference to the profits of Industrie LP.\n",
        "Furthermore, there is no mechanism in the Treaty or in Division 11A (or elsewhere) which would permit the apportionment for which DAPFI contends.\n",

        " 'Net income means, for any period, income derived from the assets of the Partnership (including any distribution from the Luca Limited Partnership which the managing general partners of the Luca Limited Partnership has, in the period, resolved to make, even if' distributable at a later date) less expenses incurred in deriving that income calculated prior to any distributions to the Partners, with the following adjustments:\n",

        " (a) any non-deductible expenditures of the Partnership (other than capital expenditures that are not otherwise taken into account in computing Net Income pursuant to this definition, shall be subtracted from such income or loss;\n",

        "\n",
        "106 'Adjusted Net Income' was defined in cl 20: see [16] above.\n",
        "107 As a result, the RLPI (US) Distribution Amount tracked the profits of the partnership in the following way:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. if Adjusted Net Income exceeded the RLPI (US) Distribution Amount (DAPFI's capital contribution multiplied by the Agreed Rate), DAPFI was entitled to the RLPI (US) Distribution Amount plus a pro-rata portion of that excess;\n",
        "\n",
        "2. if Adjusted Net Income equaled the RLPI (US) Distribution Amount plus the GPI Distribution Amount, DAPFI was entitled to that amount;\n",

        "3. if Adjusted Net Income was less than the RLPI (US) Distribution Amount plus the GPI Distribution Amount, DAPFI was entitled to a pro-rata portion of Adjusted Net Income;\n",
        "\n",
        "4. if Adjusted Net Income was a negative amount the partners would be allocated a pro-rata share of that loss by way of a debit to their respective accounts.\n",
        "108 The distribution to which DAPFI was entitled under cl 10.1 was therefore, in all cases, dependent upon the various adjustments to 'Net Income' of the partnership necessitated by cl 20.\n",
        "In these circumstances, the Commissioner submitted that it would be highly artificial to treat only the 'adjustment' itself as being referable to the profits of the partnership.\n",
        "The adjustment was rather the means by which the parties ensured that the whole of the distribution reflected the profitability of the partnership.\n",
        "109 Furthermore, as noted above, neither the Treaty nor Div 11A contains any mechanism which would permit the apportionment for which DAPFI contends.\n",
        "Article 11(9)(a) applies where the payment may be characterised as having been 'determined with reference to profits'.\n",
        "In a case such as this, where the payment can be so characterised, the whole of the payment is within the Article.\n",
        "110 Finally, DAPFI argued that the expression 'determined with reference to profits' should be construed narrowly so as not to include a distribution of profits.\n",
        "The authorities upon which DAPFI relies in this regard do not support this proposition.\n",
        "111 Neither Emu Bay Railway Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1944] HCA 28 ; (1944) 71 CLR 596 nor Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Firth [2002] FCAFC 95 ; (2002) 120 FCR 450 is a useful analogy with this case.\n",
        "112 The taxpayer in Emu Bay Railway Company 71 CLR had issued a debenture, the interest on which was only payable out of its 'net income' (akin to profit).\n",
        "It sought to deduct interest payments on this debenture under s 51(l), even though none were made because the company had no net income.\n",
        "All that was decided in that case was that no interest expense was 'incurred' because the interest was contingent on net income, of which there was none.\n",
        "113 Firth 120 FCR also concerned the deductibility of interest, in that case on a so-called 'capital protected' loan.\n",
        "The case does not bear on the interpretation of 'determined with reference to profits' in the Treaty.\n",
        "114 The Commissioner submitted that the expression 'determined with reference to profits' is well able to accommodate a situation, such as this, where the calculation of the amount paid depends entirely upon the profits (here, the Adjusted Net Income) of the issuer.\n",
        "DAPFI's Submissions in Reply\n",
        "\n",
        "115 In the Commissioner's submissions at para [104] above, it is contended that:\n",
        "\n",
        "(a) The whole of each partnership distribution was required by the terms of the partnership deed to be determined with reference to profits; and\n",
        "\n",
        "(b) there is no mechanism in the Treaty (or elsewhere) which permits apportionment.\n",
        "116 DAPFI submitted that the first of these contentions, dealt with in the Commissioner's submissions at [105]---[108] above, does not meet DAPFI's submissions at [102] and [103] above, namely, that in so far as each partnership distribution is calculated by reference to the RLPI (US) Distribution Amount (the 'Primary Entitlement' referred to in cl 10.1 (a) of the Partnership Deed), it is not 'determined with reference to profits'.\n",
        "Furthermore, the character of the portion of each partnership distribution which is so calculated is not affected by the fact that in certain circumstances the applicant either (a) may become entitled to receive a further or additional sum as well; or (b) may not receive the full amount of the RLPI (US) Distribution Amount if the Adjusted Net Income is insufficient.\n",
        "117 As to the Commissioner's second contention, the absence of express provision for apportionment in Art 11(9)(a) is not an exclusion or prohibition of an apportionment.\n",
        "A global sum payable under a contract may be apportioned where the commercial reality is that only part of the payment can be regarded as being determined with reference to profits; the apportionment should be done on the basis of a realistic estimate on sensible commercial grounds (cf., Roadshow Distributors Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue [1998] 1 VR 523 at 529).\n",
        "This approach is all the more appropriate in the case of a treaty, which should not be construed in a narrow technical way.\n",
        "118 Here the commercial reality is that the whole payment was an indirect receipt of the interest paid by CBA, and so was interest calculated without regard to any substantive 'profit' calculation.\n",
        "But insofar as there is a calculation with reference to profits, only part of the payment is so calculated, because what is payable includes a basic interest amount identified in the formula, and the apportionment can be readily done in view of the way the distributions were calculated.\n",
        "ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION ON THE ALTERNATIVE RELIEF ISSUE\n",
        "\n",
        "119 For my part, I cannot accept the proposition that the 'commercial reality' (whatever that means, but presumably a synonym for 'economic substance') is that the whole payment (the distribution from Industrie LP to DAPFI) was an indirect receipt of the interest paid by CBA.\n",
        "For a start, Industrie LP was not a mere interposed conduit between CBA and DAPFI.\n",
        "Indeed, Industrie LP did not lend to CBA; it invested the whole of its funds in another NSW limited partnership, Luca LP: see [11] above.\n",
        "And even Luca LP did not lend the whole of its funds to CBA; $2 million was lent at interest to other financial institutions.\n",
        "120 I am unable therefore to accept the proposition that, from the perspective of commercial reality, the whole payment from Industrie LP to DAPFI '... was interest calculated without regard to any substantive profit' calculation.\n",
        "121 Moreover, there were in fact profit calculations.\n",
        "There were profit calculations at the level of Luca LP, and there were profit calculations at the level of Industrie LP.\n",
        "The definition of 'Net Income' at [105] above, and of 'Adjusted Net Income' at [16] above, involve a profit calculation for any period ('... income derived ... less expenses incurred ...') and DAPFI's entitlement was determined by reference to that profit calculation.\n",
        "122 DAPFI's entitlement, contrary to its submission, was never a basic interest amount plus or minus a calculation by reference to profit.\n",
        "DAPFI never had an entitlement to a 'basic interest amount', whether identified in a formula or otherwise.\n",
        "At the very most, it was entitled to a share of 'Adjusted Net Income' and the 'basic interest amount' (referred to as the 'RLPI (US) Distribution Amount') was but a component in the calculation of that share.\n",
        "That is why para (a) of cl 10.1 of the Partnership Deed, as amended, described DAPFI's entitlement as an entitlement ---\n",
        " '...to that amount of the Adjusted Net Income as equals the RLPI(U.S.) Distribution Amount for that Distribution Period ...'\n",
        "subject to the provisos which follow in (i) and (ii).\n",
        "123 I agree with the submission of the Commissioner in [108] above that '... it would be highly artificial to treat only the 'adjustment' itself (provisos (i) and (ii)) as being referable to the profits of the partnership.\n",
        "The adjustment was rather the means or mechanism by which the parties insured that the whole of the distribution reflected the profitability of the partnership.\n",
        "124 In many cases, one can obtain guidance as to the correctness of the conclusion one has come to as to the nature or character of a right or entitlement by asking: How would one plead the right or entitlement in an action to enforce the same?\n",
        "One only has to ask that question to know that the dichotomy for which DAPFI contends cannot be sustained.\n",
        "125 On the view I take, no apportionment is open.\n",
        "126 Both applications must be dismissed with costs.\n",

        " If Bidder becomes entitled to any Rights as a result of your acceptance of this Offer, it may require you to give to Bidder all documents necessary to vest title to those Rights in Bidder, or otherwise to give Bidder the benefit or value of those Rights.\n",
        "If you do not do so, or if you have received or are entitled to receive ... the benefit of those Rights, Bidder will be entitled to deduct the amount ... of those Rights from any consideration otherwise payable to you under this Offer.\n",
        "If Bidder does not, or cannot, make such a deduction, you must pay that amount to Bidder.\n",
        "Clause 9 contained the definition of \"Rights\" which included the right to all dividends and all rights to receive them attaching to or arising at or after the date of the Bidder's Statement.\n",
        "3 The Board of Rinker recommended that its shareholders reject CEMEX's offer.\n",
        "On 10 April 2007 Rinker obtained a trading halt from ASX Limited (ASX) until 12 noon on that day.\n",
        "Prior to 12 noon CEMEX reached an agreement with Rinker increasing its offer price to $US15.85 per share.\n",
        "It made an announcement to ASX advising of the increased price and stating that this was its best and final offer in the absence of a superior proposal.\n",
        "The announcement also stated:\n",
        " ... during the Restriction Period, Rinker must not pay a dividend, other than annual and half yearly dividends consistent with past practice, (provided that this does not prejudice the Bidder's rights under clause 8.8(e) of the Bidder's Statement to adjust the revised offer price in respect of any such dividend) or undertake a buy-back, capital return or other payment to shareholders without the consent of the Bidder and without prejudice to the Bidder's rights under clause 8.8(e) to make adjustments to the revised offer price, as appropriate.\n",
        "4 Before 12 noon, CEMEX also filed a copy of the Bid Agreement and a Notice of Variation with ASX.\n",
        "Under the heading, \"Increase in Offer Price\", the Notice of Variation stated:\n",
        " CEMEX Australia will not exercise its rights under clause 8.8(e) of the Offer terms in respect of the interim dividend of A$0.16 per Rinker Share declared by Rinker with a record date of 24 November 2006 but may exercise those rights in respect of any subsequent dividend.\n",
        "5 On 27 April 2007, in its report for the year ending 31 March 2007 Rinker announced that it would pay a final dividend of $0.25 with a record date of 8 June 2007.\n",
        "On 7 May 2007, CEMEX announced to ASX that Rinker shareholders would be entitled to a final dividend of $0.25 per share if they accepted the offer and CEMEX would not deduct the dividend from its best and final offer price of $US15.85 for each Rinker share.\n",
        "6 On 13 June, the second respondent, Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC), concerned that CEMEX's conduct departed from the \"best and final\" offer, applied to the Panel pursuant to s 657A(2)(a) of the Corporations Act to make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances.\n",
        "On 12 July 2007, the Panel made a declaration that CEMEX's conduct between 10 April and 7 May constituted \"unacceptable circumstances\" and ordered that CEMEX pay the affected shareholders an amount of $0.25 per share for the net number of Rinker shares sold during the above period.\n",

        "8 The written submissions of the Panel outlined its history, commencing with its establishment under Part 10 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (Cth).\n",
        "When that Act was repealed and replaced by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ( ASIC Act ), the Panel continued in existence by operation of s 261 of that Act.\n",

        "\n",
        "21 The review Panel published detailed reasons for its conclusion that on 7 May 2007 CEMEX departed from its best and final offer statement, its decision to make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances and its subsequent orders.\n",
        "By way of overview, the Panel provided a short summary of its reasoning in which it made the following points:\n",
        " The review Panel considered that the 10 April announcement included a best and final statement.\n",
        "CEMEX did not clearly, unambiguously and proximately reserve the right to improve the Offer consideration (other than in the event of a superior proposal).\n",
        "An aspect of the best and final statement was that CEMEX was assuring the market that it would not improve its Offer consideration in the absence of a superior proposal.\n",
        "Allowing shareholders to retain the dividend was an improvement in the Offer consideration.\n",
        "There was no superior proposal.\n",
        "The 7 May announcement departed from and was inconsistent with the assurance in the 10 April announcement.\n",
        "The market for Rinker Shares between the 10 April announcement and the 7 May announcement reflected (among other things) CEMEX's best and final statement.\n",
        "Sellers sold on the basis of that market.\n",
        "After the 7 May announcement the market reflected (among other things) the improved Offer consideration.\n",
        "The review Panel was satisfied that the departure from the 10 April announcement was unacceptable having regard to the effect it had on:\n",
        "\n",
        " (a) the control or potential control of Rinker,\n",
        " (b) the acquisition of a substantial interest in Rinker by CEMEX,\n",
        " (c) the acquisition of control over voting shares in Rinker taking place in an efficient and informed market, or\n",
        " (d) holders of the relevant class having a reasonable and equal opportunity to participate in any benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "22 In its detailed reasons, the Panel referred to figures provided by ASIC which showed that in the 18 trading days after the 10 April announcement (that is until the 7 May announcement) approximately twice as many shares were traded, and twice as many trades were made, as in the 18 days before the 10 April announcement.\n",
        "The Panel also stated that, following the 7 May announcement:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " (a) the closing price of Rinker shares on the ASX was A$0.34 (on 7 May) above the closing price on 4 May (the previous trading day).\n",
        "(b) acceptances of the Offer went from approximately 3.24% on 7 May to 95.66% when the Offer closed on 16 July 2007.\n",
        "After the 10 April announcement, acceptances went from approximately 0.03% to 3.24% before the 7 May announcement.\n",
        "\n",
        "23 The review Panel said that, for reasons that did not include a contravention of the Act, it was satisfied that the circumstances were unacceptable.\n",
        "It said:\n",
        " Contravention is not a factor in this case.\n",
        "While there may be a question about whether CEMEX varied its Offer without following section 650B, this is not the basis for the Panel's declaration.\n",
        "The declaration is based on CEMEX's departure from its best and final statement.\n",
        "24 It may well be that the Panel's concern to make quite clear that it was not basing its decision on a finding that there had been a contravention of the Corporations Act was because its decision predated the decision of the High Court in Attorney-General (Cth) v Alinta Ltd [2008] HCA 2 ; (2008) 242 ALR 1.\n",
        "At the time, therefore, the question of whether s 657A(2)(b) involved the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth had not been authoritatively determined.\n",
        "25 The review Panel rejected CEMEX's submission that the terms of its best and final offer should be construed as retaining for CEMEX a discretion whether or not it would deduct the amount of the dividend paid to Rinker shareholders or that it had qualified its 10 April announcement by reserving such a discretion.\n",
        "It referred to analysts' reports submitted by CEMEX and found that of the seven reports submitted, only one expressed the view that CEMEX could allow Rinker shareholders to retain the benefit of the final dividend, two expressed a contrary view and the others did not address the matter.\n",
        "26 The review Panel also referred to the statement made by Rinker on 27 April 2007, when it announced the final dividend of $0.25.\n",
        "The Rinker announcement said:\n",
        " Shareholders should note that under the terms of CEMEX's takeover offer for Rinker, CEMEX has the right to deduct the amount of the dividend (or an amount equal to its value, as are reasonably assessed by CEMEX) from the offer price payable to accepting shareholders who have or will receive that dividend.\n",
        "The Panel considered that the \"ordinary reading of the statement\" would merely remind shareholders of the terms of CEMEX's offer and would not convey the meaning that CEMEX might improve its offer, by allowing them to retain a dividend.\n",
        "27 CEMEX submitted that it would not be in the public interest for the Panel to make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances.\n",
        "In support of this submission it said that there was \"an absence of evidence\" that its conduct had any adverse effect on the market or on shareholders' rights.\n",
        "The Panel disagreed, relying inter alia on the difference between the number of trades and number of shares traded before and after the announcement of 7 May.\n",
        "28 CEMEX also submitted that there had been no allegation or finding of a contravention of the Corporations Act or any inquiry into whether the conduct might amount to a contravention of the Corporations Act .\n",
        "In the absence of such an inquiry CEMEX argued, by reference only to broad policy considerations and without any reference to questions such as \"whether the relevant conduct affected the market or any party suffered loss\", that the review Panel's orders would impose a significant penalty on CEMEX.\n",
        "The Panel rejected both those submissions.\n",
        "The review Panel's orders\n",
        "\n",
        "29 Consequent on its declaration of unacceptable circumstances the Panel made a number of detailed orders.\n",
        "The Panel's power to make orders derives from s 657D(2) of the Corporations Act which relevantly authorised the Panel to make,\n",
        " any order (including a remedial order but not including an order directing a person to comply with a requirement of Chapter 6, 6A, 6B or 6C) that it thinks appropriate to:\n",
        "\n",
        " (a) if the Panel is satisfied that the rights or interests of any person, or group of persons, have been or are being affected, or will be or are likely to be affected, by the circumstances - protect those rights or interests, or any other rights or interests, of that person or group of persons; ...\n",
        "\n",
        "30 The Panel made a number of orders, the primary order being order 3 which was in the following terms:\n",
        " Subject to Order 14, CEMEX shall pay to each Affected Shareholder who signs and returns a claim form (within the applicable period specified in Order 10) $A0.25 per share for the net number of Rinker shares the Affected Shareholder disposed of a beneficial interest in during the Relevant Period as set out in the claim form.\n",
        "In the context of this order, \"Affected Shareholder\" was defined as meaning \"a person who disposed of a beneficial interest in a net number of Rinker shares during the \"Relevant Period\".\n",
        "\" The \"Relevant Period\" was defined to mean the period between 10 April and 7 May 2007.\n",
        "Order 14 dealt with disputes concerning entitlement to payment.\n",
        "31 Orders 21, 22 and 23 provided that CEMEX was to establish a Special Purpose Account in which it was to deposit $15 million to be used to make the payments required by order 3.\n",
        "Other orders established procedures by which applications for payment were to be submitted and processed, how the money was to be paid, determinations of special circumstances, disputes as to entitlement to payment, requesting of further information, and other orders relating to the administration of the payments.\n",
        "GROUNDS OF REVIEW\n",
        "\n",
        "32 CEMEX seeks review of the declaration and orders of the review Panel on a number of grounds.\n",
        "I shall deal with each ground of review in turn.\n",
        "Declaration\n",
        "\n",
        "33 CEMEX's first ground of review is that making the declaration of unacceptable circumstances was, within the meaning of s 5(1)(e) of the ADJR Act, an improper exercise of the power conferred by s 657A of the Corporations Act .\n",
        "CEMEX alleged that the Panel failed to take into account:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " (i) whether, and if so the extent to which, CEMEX's conduct constituted or gave rise to a contravention of Chapters 6, 6A, 6B or 6C of the Corporations Act ;\n",
        " (ii) the extent to which any person was misled or confused or suffered loss by any conduct of CEMEX;\n",
        " (iii) the matters referred to in s 657A(3) of the Corporations Act ; ...\n",
        "\n",
        "34 Moreover, it was alleged that the failure in (a) above, and the failure to consider the specific effect of the unacceptable circumstances, was so unreasonable an exercise of the power conferred by s 657A that no reasonable person could have so exercised the power.\n",
        "35 The ADJR Act provides that an improper exercise of power includes, inter alia, taking an irrelevant consideration into account in the exercise of the power and failing to take a relevant consideration into account: s 5(2).\n",
        "CEMEX submitted that in declining to have regard to whether its conduct gave rise to a contravention of Chapters 6, 6A, 6B, or 6C of the Corporations Act or was otherwise contrary to law, the Panel ignored a consideration that it was bound to take into account in making the decision: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40.\n",
        "It is not in dispute that the Panel expressly declined to consider this question.\n",
        "Therefore the only issue for me to decide on this point is whether the Panel was required to have regard to it.\n",
        "36 Section 657A(3)(a)(ii) imposes an obligation on the Panel, when contemplating a declaration of unacceptable circumstances, to have regard to \"the other provisions of this Chapter [6]\".\n",
        "CEMEX submitted that, because of the express reference in s 657A(2)(c) to Chapters 6A, 6B and 6C, the obligation extends also to those chapters.\n",
        "It accepted that a declaration of unacceptable circumstances may be made even if the circumstances do not give rise to a contravention of the Act; s 657A(1).\n",
        "It submitted, however, that a consideration need not be determinative to render it relevant.\n",
        "CEMEX referred to the Panel's observation that forming a view about whether a contravention had occurred would only be one aspect of considering whether the circumstances were unacceptable.\n",
        "It argued that it did not follow that the issue could be ignored.\n",
        "37 CEMEX's submissions advocate a mechanistic approach to the interpretation of s 657A(3)(a).\n",
        "This is not what the section requires.\n",
        "An obligation to have regard to Chapter 6 does not require the decision maker to consider whether there has been a contravention of each and every applicable provision.\n",
        "The task of the Panel was to consider whether, as ASIC alleged, unacceptable circumstances had arisen.\n",
        "Section 657A(3)(a) sets out the matters that it is mandatory for the Panel to consider.\n",
        "The question of whether there has been a contravention of Chapters 6, 6A, 6B, 6C is not included as a mandatory matter.\n",
        "The fact that s 657A(1) specifically provides that it is not necessary for there to be a contravention of a provision of the Act, indicates that if the Panel considered CEMEX's conduct resulted in unacceptable circumstances irrespective of there being a contravention, it was not necessary for it to consider if there had been a contravention.\n",
        "It is clear that the fact of a contravention would be highly relevant to the question of whether the circumstances should be characterised as \"unacceptable\".\n",
        "If, however, such circumstances exist irrespective of a contravention, it is not necessary for the Panel to consider that issue.\n",
        "38 The regulatory framework which Chapter 6 establishes is, as Gleeson CJ observed in Attorney General (Cth) v Alinta Ltd at 4, designed \"to preserve an efficient, competitive and informed capital market\".\n",
        "Section 657A(1) recognises that the conduct of a takeover may be inconsistent with such a market even where it does not contravene a specific provision of the Corporations Act .\n",
        "Emmett J recognised this in Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel [2006] FCA 274 ; (2006) 151 FCR 77 at 108:\n",
        " The panel, of course, is expressly empowered by s 657A(1) to make declarations notwithstanding that there has been no contravention of the Act.\n",
        "Part 6.10 of the Act provides flexibility in the regulation of the acquisition of shares in circumstances where the literal operation of the regulatory regime is either unnecessarily restrictive or ineffective to achieve the object of Ch 6.\n",
        "It is clear enough that the regime involving the panel is designed to ensure regulation of the acquisition of shares over and above the provisions contained in the balance of Ch 6: ...\n",
        "The panel made its declaration because, notwithstanding compliance by Glencore and the Banks with the disclosure regime prescribed by the Act, the purposes of Ch 6, as expressed in s 602 , were not achieved.\n",
        "That is precisely the circumstance for which s 657A provides.\n",
        "It is not unreasonable for the panel, if its decision was otherwise lawful and authorised, to reach that conclusion.\n",
        "39 The Corporations Act specifically reposes in the Panel the responsibility for deciding whether conduct is \"unacceptable\".\n",
        "The conclusion which the review Panel reached was open to it and I find no error in it reaching that conclusion.\n",
        "40 CEMEX also submitted that the Panel had misconstrued its Bidder's Statement, its best and final offer statement made on 10 April 2007, the notice of variation of offer made on 10 April 2007, the fourth supplementary bidder's statement dated 17 April 2007, the fifth supplementary bidder's statement dated 18 April 2007.\n",
        "It submitted that, correctly construed, clauses 8.1(c), and 8.8(e) of the Bidder's Statement had the effect of preserving for CEMEX a discretion as to whether or not it would take steps to receive the benefit or value of any future Rinker dividend from accepting Rinker shareholders.\n",
        "It also argued that on a correct construction, the best and final offer statement indicated that CEMEX reserved a discretion to decide whether or not it would take steps to receive the benefit or value of any future Rinker dividend from accepting Rinker shareholders.\n",
        "41 In essence, all of these allegations make the same basic point, which is that in all of the statements referred to above, CEMEX had reserved to itself a discretion (Dividend Discretion) to decide in respect of each and every dividend declared by Rinker, whether or not it would deduct the amount of any such dividend from payments made to Rinker shareholders for each share sold to CEMEX.\n",
        "The review Panel considered the arguments put to it by CEMEX that it had at all times, reserved a Dividend Discretion and rejected the arguments.\n",
        "42 I agree with the submission made by ASIC that these contentions are, in substance, a challenge to the Panel's findings of fact.\n",
        "This challenge is not available to CEMEX in the present proceeding.\n",
        "In any event, I do not accept the construction for which CEMEX contends.\n",
        "In my view the Panel correctly interpreted CEMEX's best and final offer statement as being a statement that the offer would not be increased except in the context of a higher offer from another source.\n",
        "In its statement of 7 May 2007 CEMEX offered Rinker shareholders an additional sweetener by allowing them to retain the benefit of the dividend of $0.25 per share.\n",
        "This was an increase in the consideration for the shares and, in my view, it was contrary to the position advanced in CEMEX's best and final offer statement.\n",
        "43 I do not accept that clause 8.8(e) of the Bidder's statement gave CEMEX a discretion to decide whether or not to take the benefit of future dividends.\n",
        "In my view the Panel's analysis of the Statement was correct for the reasons it gave.\n",
        "It is consistent with the plain meaning of the Statement and, as ASIC submitted, it is reinforced by the clear terms of s 8.1(c) of the Bidder's Statement, to the effect that if CEMEX bought a shareholder's Rinker securities, then CEMEX was entitled to all rights in respect of those securities.\n",
        "There is nothing in the other statements to which CEMEX referred that casts doubt on this construction and it is not necessary to add anything more on this point.\n",
        "Orders\n",
        "\n",
        "44 CEMEX challenges the orders made by the Panel on grounds that may be summarised as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 1.\n",
        "The orders were not authorised by s 657D , as that provision:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " (a) did not authorise the Panel to order a person to pay an amount of money to another person, either at all or, alternatively, in the absence of satisfaction that the latter person has suffered loss or damage as a result of the circumstances declared to be unacceptable; and\n",
        "\n",
        " (b) did not authorise the Panel to delegate to ASIC the duty to decide whether a person must pay an amount of money to another person.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. the Panel improperly exercised the power conferred by s 657D by:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " (a) failing to take into account relevant considerations, being whether CEMEX's conduct constituted a contravention of Chapters 6, 6A, 6B or 6C of the Act; whether any Affected Shareholder relied on or suffered loss as a result of any conduct on the part of CEMEX; and whether the takeover bid would have proceeded differently, if the unacceptable circumstances had not occurred; and\n",
        "\n",
        " (b) making a decision in the context of the absence of evidence concerning the extent to which the rights or interests of Affected Shareholders were actually affected by the unacceptable circumstances, that being unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense.\n",
        "3.\n",
        "The Panel erred in law within the meaning of s 5(1)(f) of the ADJR Act in various respects, arising out of the above grounds, including by concluding that an order could be made to \"protect\" rights or interests which no longer existed at the time the orders were made.\n",
        "45 These grounds raise three issues: (1) whether the Panel had power to order CEMEX to pay each Affected Shareholder $0.25 in respect of each share sold during the Relevant Period in the absence of a finding that each Affected Shareholder had suffered a loss; (2) whether the orders involved an impermissible delegation of power to ASIC; and (3) whether the orders invalidly attempted to \"protect\" rights or interests that no longer existed.\n",
        "Did the Affected Shareholders need to prove individual financial loss?\n",
        "\n",
        "46 The essence of this complaint is that s 657D(2)(a) while the Panel is authorised to make orders that protect rights or interests affected by the unacceptable circumstances, it is not given power to order that payment be made to individuals who have not shown financial loss.\n",
        "Consequently, where there is no evidence before the Panel that any individual Rinker shareholder suffered financial loss as a result of CEMEX's conduct order for payment is beyond power.\n",
        "The absence of such evidence meant the Panel was not in a position to determine whether there was a \"reasonable connection between the extent to which the right/interest has been affected and the extent to which it is sought to be protected\".\n",
        "As CEMEX stated in its written submissions:\n",
        " In the absence of such evidence, the Panel lacked the ability to determine whether any person's rights or interests had been affected and whether any order made by it would \"protect\" the shareholders' rights/interests.\n",
        "This is because individual shareholders may have suffered no loss or may have suffered a loss lesser or greater than the final dividend.\n",
        "47 As an example of a shareholder who suffered no loss CEMEX put forward the hypothetical case of a shareholder who utilised the proceeds from the sale of Rinker shares to purchase stock in BHP and whose BHP shares increased in value at a higher rate than the Rinker shares would have increased in an efficient market.\n",
        "Such a shareholder, it submitted, would have suffered no loss and therefore the review Panel's orders would confer a windfall on that shareholder at the expense of CEMEX.\n",
        "This example assumes that the only relevant loss is financial.\n",
        "48 The notion that s 657D(2)(a) does not permit the Panel to make orders on the basis of a so-called \" en globo \" assessment of the likely loss or damages suffered by Rinker shareholders was said by CEMEX to be supported by Emmett J's comments in Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel (2005) 54 ACSR 708 at 722, where his Honour said:\n",
        " [T]he review panel took no steps to determine whether, and if so, in what manner, any right or interest of any such person was affected by the non-disclosure.\n",
        "While the orders were purportedly made for the purposes of protecting the rights or interests of persons affected by the non-disclosure, the order applied indiscriminately to any person who sold shares on ASX during the relevant period, irrespective of whether any such person would have taken any different course had the relevant disclosure been made.\n",
        "49 This submission does not take account of the amendments to the Corporations Act made by the Corporations Amendment (Takeovers) Act 2007 (Cth).\n",
        "The Explanatory Memorandum to the corresponding Bill makes it clear that the amendments were designed to respond to the concern that, following Glencore , \"it may be open to read the Panel's powers and jurisdiction in the current legislation in way that is too narrowly formulated to enable the Panel to perform effectively the role envisaged for it by Parliament\", in particular the power to make orders to protect the rights or interests of persons affected by unacceptable circumstances.\n",
        "In relation to s 657D(2)(a) the Explanatory Memorandum stated:\n",
        " Paragraph 657D(2)(a) of the Act currently allows the Panel to make orders it thinks appropriate to protect the rights or interests of any person affected by the circumstances.\n",
        "The amendment means that this is not confined to rights and interests directly affected by the circumstances.\n",
        "The amendment ensures that the Panel can make any order it thinks appropriate to protect any rights or interests of a person or group of persons, where the Panel is satisfied that their rights or interests have been, are being, will be or are likely to be affected by the unacceptable circumstances.\n",
        "This will allow the Panel to protect the interests of those persons more effectively.\n",
        "The amendment will also ensure that the Panel may make orders which protect the interests of a group of persons whose interests have been affected, rather than requiring it to address the effects person by person.\n",
        "(Emphasis added.\n",
        ")\n",
        "50 I am satisfied that the Court was entitled to proceed en globo in its assessment of the extent to which shareholder's rights or interests were affected by the unacceptable circumstances.\n",
        "First, as well as being consistent with the express words of s 657D(2)(a) (\"if the Panel is satisfied that the rights or interest of any person, or a group of persons ...\"), such an approach recognises that the unacceptable circumstances misinformed the market as to the status of CEMEX's offer, thereby affecting the rights and interests of vendors of Rinker shares in that market, as a group.\n",
        "Counsel for ASIC, in my view accurately, summarised the steps taken by the Panel as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "&#8226; identifying a group of persons, namely those who sold their Rinker shares between 10 April and 7 May 2007;\n",
        "\n",
        "&#8226; identifying the interests of those persons affected by the conduct, being the interest in ensuring that the relevant trading occurred in an efficient and informed market, and the interest in having a reasonable opportunity to participate in the benefits of the improved offer;\n",
        "\n",
        "&#8226; making a finding that the market value of the improved offer consideration was around $0.25; and\n",
        "\n",
        "&#8226; forming the view that an appropriate order was to compensate those persons in that amount.\n",
        "51 In my view, there is no error in this approach.\n",
        "Disclosed in those steps was a reasonable connection between the extent to which the right or interest has been affected and the extent to which it was sought to be protected.\n",
        "That connection was based on the finding, open to the Panel, that persons who sold shares between 10 April and 7 May did so in a market that was not efficient and informed, and in particular they lost the opportunity to include as part of their decision to sell, the information that the offer consideration might be improved; and that the value of the final dividend was the best estimate of the value of the lost opportunity.\n",
        "That opportunity was lost whether or not any particular shareholder went on to purchase BHP shares which increased in value at a rate higher than Rinker shares would have in an efficient market.\n",
        "That is, the opportunity was lost by each Affected Shareholder irrespective of whether any individual Affected Shareholder actually suffered a financial loss because of the unacceptable circumstances.\n",
        "It therefore cannot be said that the Panel failed to have regard to whether loss was suffered.\n",
        "52 The concept of the loss as the opportunity to participate in an informed and efficient market is underpinned by the purposes of Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act , referred to above at [14].\n",
        "In particular, the purpose of ensuring that acquisition take place in an efficient, competitive and informed market is a legitimate interest of all persons participating in the market.\n",
        "Where, as here, the actions of a person or a company are found to have detracted from the openness and competitiveness of the market, the purpose of Chapter 6 is to redress that problem.\n",
        "Were I to accept CEMEX's submission that purpose would be subverted.\n",
        "53 I am therefore satisfied that it was within the Tribunal's power to order CEMEX to pay each Affected Shareholder $0.25 per share sold in circumstances where they did not make a finding that each Affected Shareholder had suffered a loss.\n",
        "54 A related argument put by CEMEX was that the Panel did not satisfy itself as to whether its order would \"unfairly prejudice\" CEMEX, as required by s 657D(1).\n",
        "According to CEMEX:\n",
        " In order to properly consider whether an order has the potential to be unfair it must be relevant to consider whether the conduct of the intended payer is a contravention of Chapter 6, 6A, 6B or 6C of the Act.\n",
        "That is because an order is more likely to unfairly prejudice a person if his or her conduct gives rise to unacceptable circumstances but does not involve a contravention of the Act\n",
        "55 As I have already concluded, s 657A does not require the Panel to consider if there has been a contravention before making a declaration of unacceptable circumstances.\n",
        "Section 657D(1) requires that the Panel \"must not make an order if it is satisfied that the order would unfairly prejudice any person\".\n",
        "The Panel reached the requisite level of satisfaction in this case:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " (a) As a result of the unacceptable circumstances persons who sold shares between the 10 April and 7 May announcements did so in a market that was not efficient and informed.\n",
        "They lost the opportunity to include as part of their decision to sell the information that the Offer consideration might be improved.\n",
        "The value of the final dividend is, in the review Panel's opinion, the most logical and best estimate of the value of the lost opportunity.\n",
        "(b) CEMEX's best estimate to the initial Panel of the relevant number of shares involved (i.e., the net sales between the two announcements) was 44,849,359, and the amount involved was A$11,212,340.\n",
        "That must be compared to the benefits that CEMEX received by departing from its best and final statement.\n",
        "Allowing shareholders to retain the benefit of the final dividend significantly, if not wholly, contributed to the success of the Offer.\n",
        "The total value of the Offer was approximately $A17 billion.\n",
        "CEMEX submitted as its best estimate to the initial Panel, that the value of the final dividend was approximately A$223.7 million.\n",
        "Relative to these amounts, the likely amount of the payment order is not out of proportion or otherwise unfair.\n",
        "\n",
        "56 It follows that CEMEX's argument that the Panel improperly failed to take into account whether their conduct constituted a contravention of Chapters 6, 6A, 6B or 6C of the Corporations Act must be rejected.\n",
        "It also follows from my findings that the Panel's orders cannot be said to be unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense; Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223.\n",
        "Was there an impermissible delegation of power?\n",
        "\n",
        "57 CEMEX alleges that the orders involve an impermissible delegation of power in that they establish, by orders 14-16, a mechanism by which ASIC is given the power to determine authoritatively whether a person is an Affected Shareholder and is therefore entitled to the payment.\n",
        "The mechanism set up by orders 14-16 is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 14.\n",
        "CEMEX may refer a claim to ASIC, within 2 weeks of CEMEX or the ISP receiving the claim form (whichever is earlier).\n",

        "59 For several reasons I do not accept that the mechanism provided in orders 14-16 involves an impermissible delegation.\n",
        "First, ASIC has not been given the power to determine conclusively whether a person is an Affected Shareholder.\n",
        "The orders clearly define membership of that category.\n",
        "Initially it is CEMEX which considers the question.\n",
        "Disputes are referred to ASIC which, if it is unable to make a determination, may refer the matter to the Panel.\n",
        "It is therefore the Panel which ultimately has the power to resolve a dispute about whether a person is an Affected Shareholder.\n",
        "60 Secondly, given the nature of the Panel, and its constitution, I accept ASIC's submission that:\n",
        " Parliament cannot be taken to have intended that the Panel itself would be required to administer each and every step of any order made by the Panel.\n",
        "Indeed, ASIC is specifically charged with the function of providing staff and support facilities to the Panel.\n",
        "Even if the assignment of administrative responsibilities to ASIC is not within the terms of s 657D , it would be implied into the power given the sheer administrative necessities of the legislative scheme.\n",
        "61 Thirdly, the relevant criterion is whether Rinker shares were sold in the relevant period.\n",
        "This is a matter of fact that will be established or not by the evidence.\n",
        "It is not a matter that depends on the decision-maker's discretion.\n",
        "Do the orders involve a protection of rights or interests that no longer existed?\n",
        "\n",
        "62 The final argument made by CEMEX challenging the orders of the Panel was that because s 657D(2)(a) requires that any order made be appropriate to protect rights and interests, those orders must be protective rather than compensatory; and that the Panel erred in concluding that an order could be made to protect rights or interests which no longer exist at the time the order is made.\n",
        "This is on the basis that:\n",
        " ... the opportunity said to have been lost by the Panel could only have been enjoyed by Affected Shareholders while they continued to own Rinker shares.\n",
        "Moreover, given the delisting of Rinker, Affected Shareholders could never be in a position to enjoy that opportunity again.\n",
        "As a result, any such right or interest, even though not now in existence, cannot be characterised as prospective or contingent in nature.\n",
        "63 CEMEX went on to submit that:\n",
        " The orders provided for in section 657D are prophylactic in nature.\n",
        "They are designed to negate, for the future, any detrimental effect suffered to a person's right or interest by virtue of an unacceptable circumstance.\n",
        "That policy cannot be achieved where the right or interest no longer exists.\n",
        "An order requiring the payment of money is such circumstances must, necessarily, be characterised as compensatory in nature.\n",
        "64 ASIC submitted that this contention is inconsistent with the wording of the Corporations Act , which expressly contemplates the protection of rights or interests that, at the time the order is made, have already been affected; (\"... if the Panel is satisfied that the rights or interests of any person, or group of persons, have been or are being affected\").\n",
        "This submission does not distinguish between merely impairing rights or interests and affecting them to the point of extinction.\n",
        "The applicant relies on such a distinction.\n",
        "In my view the distinction is unwarranted.\n",
        "I accept ASIC's submission that such an approach is inconsistent with the policy of the legislation and that there is nothing in s 657D(2) to indicate that rights and interests must exist at the time the order is made.\n",
        "ASIC made the further point that:\n",
        " Such a conclusion is reinforced by the distinction between s 657D(2)(a) and (b).\n",
        "Sub-paragraph (b) is obviously intended to be used, if it can be, during the course of a takeover.\n",
        "Sub-paragraph (a) is obviously intended to have an operation outside the terms of sub-paragraph (b).\n",
        "An obvious instance of when this could occur is after the takeover has been completed.\n",
        "65 In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Yandal Gold Pty Ltd (1999) 32 ASCR 317, Merkel J considered a contravention of s 615 of the then-applicable Corporations Law .\n",
        "Section 737 empowered the Court to \"make such order or orders as it thinks just\" and s 739(1) empowered a court to make \"such orders as it thinks necessary or desirable to protect the interests of a person affected by the takeover scheme\".\n",
        "His Honour held at 354-355:\n",
        " However, there might be a more appropriate and just remedy.\n",
        "It relates to Edensor's carried interest.\n",
        "Mr Lonergan's evidence, which valued that interest at $27-30 million, was only partly challenged by the respondents.\n",
        "As explained earlier, that is effectively the \"price\" paid by the Normandy group to Edensor to secure the bid structure agreement and the Shareholders Agreement or, put another way, a measure of the benefit obtained by Edensor by its contraventions of s 615.\n",
        "As a consequence of the payment of that \"price\" the shareholders were deprived of the opportunity of receiving an offer of a significantly higher price at the time of the bid and were left with little practical choice but to accept the offer made or to now exercise their right to require the acquisition by Yandal Gold of their shares pursuant to s 703(2).\n",
        "Is it just that that \"price\" be redirected to those who suffered the detriment arising from its payment?\n",
        "In my view an order that Edensor be required to disgorge to those shareholders the value of the benefit it received for its contravening conduct is \"just\" under s 737 and is protective of the interests of the shareholders under s 739.\n",

Justice ANTONY DOMINIC Dated :07/11/2008 O R D E R ANTONY DOMINIC, J ----------------------------------------------------------- W.P.(C).No.32715/2008 ----------------------------------------------------------- Dated this the 6th day of November, 2008 JUDGMENT Exts.P1 to P47 are the orders appointing the petitioners as HSSTs in the Government Higher Secondary Schools. Petitioners submit that prior to their appointment as HSSTs, they had service in aided schools and relying on Exts.P48 and P49 Govt. orders, it is contended that, for conferring higher grade, prior service in the aided school is liable to be reckoned. With that request they have moved the first respondent by filing Ext.P50 representation and in this writ petition the main complaint is that there is delay in considering and passing orders on Ext.P50. Petitioner therefore seek a direction to the first respondent to dispose of Ext.P50 on an expeditious basis. 2 Having regard to the limited nature of the relief that is sought for, I direct that the first respondent shall dispose of Ext.P50, as expeditiously as possible and at any rate within 3 weeks from the date of production of a coy of the judgment. It is directed that one of the petitioners be heard before final orders are passed. Writ Petition is disposed of as above. ANTONY DOMINIC JUDGE vi. 3\"\"\", 'category': 1},\n",
        "    {'text': \"\"\"Name of accused- Convicted under section Sentence awarded appellant Bali alias Banal Singh 376 IPC Five years' RI and a fine of Rs. 500/-, in default of payment of fine, to further undergo RI for 3 months. 450 IPC Three years' RI and a fine of Rs. 500/-, in default of payment of fine, to further undergo RI for 3 months. The above sentences were ordered to run concurrently. 2. The facts giving rise to this appeal, in short, are as follows :- JUDGMENT Sunil Kumar Garg, J. 1. This is an appeal by the accused-appellant against the judgment and order dated 30-4-1982 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Sri Ganganagar in Sessions Case No. 34/1981, by which the learned Sessions Judge convicted the accused-appellant for the offence under Sections 376 and 450, IPC and sentenced in the following manner:- On 10-1-1981, PW-1 Indobai lodged an oral report Ex. P/1 before PW-7 Mani Ram, who was SHO on that day at Police Station, Matilirathan District Sri Ganganagar stating inter alia that day before yesterday she had gone to Gurusar to take the Muklawa of her son Mahendra and Mahendra was also with her. It is further stated in the report that at her house, she has left her daughters Mst. Mukhtyaro, PW-2 (prosecutrix) aged about 28 years and Guddi, PW-3 aged about 16 years and Pappi, aged about 10 years and her husband was also out of station and had gone to Bikaner. PW-2 Mukhtyaro was married and she had one son of one and half years and for the last one and half years, she has been living with PW-1 Indobai. It is further stated in the report that on the previous day i.e. on 9-1-1981, she has come to her house and when she came she was informed by PW-2 Mukhtyaro (prosecutrix) that at about 2.00 p.m. when she was sitting in her house on the cot and combing her hair, Guddi and Pappi had gone to the field and accused-appellant came there and committed rape on her. It is further stated in the report that thereafter PW-3 Shishuguddi came there and she made hue and cry and thereafter, accused-appellant ran away from the scene and when he was running, he was seen by PW-5 Kartar Singh and PW-4 Chandu Ram. It is further stated in the report that as she was having no transportation, therefore, report has been lodged on the next day i.e. on 10-1-1981. On this report, PW-7 Maniram registered the case and started investigation. During investigation, PW-2 Mukhtyaro (prosecutrix) was got medically examined by PW-6 Dr. Rajendra Kumar and her medical examination report is Ex. P/3 and the report determining her age is Ex. P/4, where her age has been determined as 20 years. After usual investigation, a challan was filed against the accused-appellant in the Court of Magistrate and from where the case was committed to the Court of Session. On 28-7-1981, the learned Sessions Judge, Sri Ganganagar framed charges against the accused-appellant for the offence under Sections 376 and 450, IPC. The charges were read over and explained to the accused-appellant. The accused-appellant denied the charges and claimed trial. During the course of trial, the prosecution examined as many as seven witnesses and got exhibited several documents. Thereafter, statement of the accused-appellant under Section 313, Cr.P.C. was recorded. No evidence was led by the accused-appellant in defence. After conclusion of trial, the learned Sessions Judge, Sri Ganganagar vide his judgment and order dated 30-4-1982 convicted the accused-appellant for the offence under Sections 376 and 450, IPC and sentenced in the manner as stated above. Before proceeding further, it may be stated here that when the statement of PW-2 Mukhtyaro (prosecutrix) was being recorded by the learned Sessions Judge, he felt that she was suffering from mental disease and she was not in a position to give statement and, therefore, he ordered that her mental state be got examined by the doctor. On the file, there is a report of the Superintendent, Mental Hospital, Jaipur dated 27-2-1982, which speaks that PW-2 Mukhtyaro was suffering from mental retardation and her mental age was three years and I.Q. was 21. It may further be stated here that because of this fact her statement could not be recorded and proceedings have taken place in the absence of her statement. The learned Sessions Judge while recording conviction of the accused-appellant came to the following conclusions :- 1. That on the date of incident, PW-2 Mukhtyaro (prosecutrix) was patient of mental retardation. 2. That PW-6 Dr. Rajendra Kumar has proved X-ray report Ex. P/4 and has come to the conclusion that on the date of incident, the age of PW-2 Mukhtyaro (prosecutrix) was 20 years. 3. That PW-6 Dr. Rajendra Kumar has come to the conclusion that no definite opinion can be given about the commission of rape with PW-2 Mukhtyaro in the absence of FSL report and the FSL report has not been produced in the present case. 4. That the learned Sessions Judge has relied on the evidence of PW-3 Shishuguddi and after relying on her statement, he has convicted the accused-appellant for the offence under Sections 376 and 450, IPC. Aggrieved from the said judgment and order dated 30-4-1982 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Sri Ganganagar, the present appeal has been filed by the accused-appellant. 3. In this appeal, the following submissions have been made by the learned counsel for the accused-appellant :- 1. That there is no evidence of intercourse with PW-2 Mukhtyaro (prosecutrix) by accused-appellant and there is also no evidence on record which shows that PW2 Mukhtyaro has any injury on her private part and thus, there is no medical evidence in this case and in such circumstances, in absence of statement of PW-2 Mukhtyaro, the conviction of the accused-appellant for the offence under Sections 376, IPC cannot be maintained. 2. That since there is statement of PW-3 Shishuguddi which shows that she saw the accused-appellant committing rape on PW-2 Mukhtyaro (prosecutrix), therefore, from this point of view also, a case at the most under Section 354, IPC can be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt and not under Section 376, IPC, as the fact that sexual intercourse by accused-appellant with her has taken place in actual form has not been established by the prosecution. 3. That the accused-appellant is in jail for the last more than eight months and, therefore, he should be sentenced to the period already undergone by him. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor has not much controverted the above arguments, but has argued that in case the Court comes to the conclusion that a case under Section 354, IPC is made out against the accused-appellant, then, quantum of fine be raised. 5. I have heard the learned counsel for the accused-appellant and the learned Public Prosecutor and perused the record of the case. 6. So far as the fact that PW-2 Mukhtyaro (prosecutrix) was a patient of mental retardation on the date of occurrence is concerned, there is no dispute on this point and because of this reason, she has not been examined in Court and, thus, there is no evidence of the prosecutrix herself to support the findings of conviction of rape. 7. So far as the medical evidence is concerned, PW-6 Dr. Rajendra Kumar has clearly stated in his statement that no definite opinion regarding rape on PW-2 Mukhtyaro can be given for want of FSL report and FSL report has not been produced in the present case. There is no dispute on the point that PW-2 Mukhtyaro was having no injury on her private part when she was got medically examined and she was a married woman. 8. PW-1 Indo Bai, who lodged the oral report Ex. P/1 on 10-1-1981, has stated that she was informed by PW-2 Mukhtyaro that accused-appellant has committed rape on her, but she has admitted in her cross-examination that at that time she did not find her clothes torn up. She has further stated that PW-2 Mukhtyaro is an innocent girl and her mental power is very weak. 9. PW-3 Shishuguddi is the sister of PW-2 Mukhtyaro and daughter of PW-1 Indo Bai and she states that when she came from the field, she saw accused-appellant committing rape on PW-2 Mukhtyaro and when she made hue and cry, her aunty Mst. Kako and PW-4 Chandu Ram also came there and accused-appellant ran away. 10. PW-4 Chandu Ram also admits this fact that he saw the accused-appellant running from the scene. 11. PW-5 Kartar Singh is another witness, who states that he was told by PW-3 Shishuguddi that accused-appellant teased PW-2 Mukhtyaro and, thereafter, he went inside the house and asked PW2 Mukhtyaro as to what has happened and upon this, she told him that accused-appellant has committed intercourse with her. 12. Looking to the above evidence on record and especially looking to the facts that PW-2 Mukhtyaro (prosecutrix) has not been examined in the Court; she was patient of mental retardation on the date of incident; she was married woman; she did not receive any injury on private part or other parts of her body; her clothes were not torn up; there is no actual evidence proving that sexual intercourse in actual terms has taken place with her by accused-appellant; there is statement of PW-5 Kartar Singh that he was told by PW-3 Shishuguddi that accused-appellant teased PW-2 Mukhtyaro, the case of the prosecution cannot travel beyond the offence under Section 354, IPC, as the prosecution has proved that accused-appellant used the criminal force on PW-2 Mukhtyaro with an intention to outrage her modesty and thus, the findings of the learned Sessions Judge convicting accused-appellant for the offence under Section 376, IPC cannot be maintained and accused-appellant is liable to be convicted under Section 354, IPC instead of 376, IPC. 13. So far as the conviction of accused-appellant for the offence under Section 450, IPC is concerned, the findings of the learned Sessions Judge in this respect are maintained. 14. Since the accused-appellant is going to be convicted under Section 354, IPC instead of 376, IPC, the argument of the learned counsel for the accused-appellant that he may be sentenced to the period already undergone becomes relevant. 15. As per the report on the back of the warrant, accused-appellant has been in PC and JC from 16-1-1981 to 30-1-1981 and apart from this, as per the order sheet of this Court dated 7-4-2000, it appears that accused-appellant was sent to jail and he was ordered to be released on his furnishing personal bond of Rs. 2000/- and two sureties in the like amount, but he has not furnished the same so far. Thus, he has been in jail since 7-4-2000. In my considered opinion, for the offence under Sections 354 and 450, IPC, the period which he has already undergone would be sufficient sentence to meet the ends of justice and thus, he should be sentenced to the period already undergone by him for the said offences. 16. In the result, the appeal filed by the accused-appellant Bali alias Bahal Singh is partly allowed. The conviction of the accused-appellant is altered from 376, IPC to 354, I.P.C and he is accordingly convicted under Section 354, IPC in place of 376, IPC. However, his conviction under Section 450, IPC is maintained. For the offence under Sections 354 and 450 IPC, the accused-appellant is sentenced to the period already undergone by him. The judgment and order dated 30-4-1982 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Sri Ganganagar stand modified accordingly. Since the accused-appellant Bali alias Bahal Singh is in jail, he be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.\"\"\", 'category': 1},\n",

For Petitioner : Mr.S.Murugappan For Respondents : Mr.SU.Srinivasan SPC for respondents. ORDER \"Wholesale package means a package containing - 22.12.2021 kan/shr Internet : Yes Index : Yes / No Speaking order / Nonspeaking order To The relief sought for in the present Writ Petition is to direct the respondents 3 and 4 to draw samples and certify petitioner's standard based on the specifications applicable under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page 2 of 11 \f W.P.No.30839 of 2015 2. The petitioner firm is an importer and trader in camphor and other chemicals. In the course of its business activities, the petitioner firm imported 4312 bags of sodium chloride from China. The net quantity imported is 107.8 tonnes in four containers with each bag of Sodium Chloride (Salt) weighing 25 kgs, net. The goods were supplied by M/s.China Salt Jitan Co.Ltd. The goods were accompanied by the suppliers' certificate of Analysis dated 02.07.2015 and also the certificate of Origin dated 02.07.2015. 3. Upon arrival of the goods at the Chennai Port, the petitioner firm filed a bill of entry with the first respondent as required by the Customs Department for due assessment and clearance of the consignment after completion of customs formalities. Since the goods imported were claimed as food grade sodium chloride, the matter was referred to the 3rd respondent for drawal of samples and giving their confirmation with regard to the food safety standards. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page 3 of 11 \f W.P.No.30839 of 2015 4. The 4th respondent came to inspect and draw the sample as per the directions of the third respondent. However, he did not draw any sample and instead forwarded a message online as per the practice of the 2nd respondent. The message received from the 4th respondent electronically was that “Best Before/ Use by date/ Date of expiry is not mentioned where it is required under clause 2.2.2:10 of FSS (Packaging and labelling Regulation, 2011)”. Thus, an objection was raised for drawing sample on the ground that the details regarding the manufacturing date or date of expiry in the labelling were not found. 5. Thus, the request of the petitioner for conducting the lab test was denied. Therefore, the petitioner is constrained to move the present Writ Petition. 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner drew the attention https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page 4 of 11 \f W.P.No.30839 of 2015 of this Court with reference to the relevant rules, more specifically, as per the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulation, 2011. Such a labelling in respect of wholesale quantity are exempted. When there is an exemption under the regulation in respect of whole sale packaging, there is no reason whatsoever to deny the benefit of lab test for the product imported by the petitioner. 7. The learned Central Government standing counsel reiterated by stating that in the absence of date of expiry and other details under the regulations, the authorities would not be in a position to draw sample, conduct test and send the same for testing in the lab. Relying on the counter affidavit, the learned Central Government standing counsel made a submission that in the present case such labelling and the particulars were missing and therefore the inspecting authorities refused to draw sample and there is no infirmity as such. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page 5 of 11 \f W.P.No.30839 of 2015 8. Para 1.2.1:(6) of the Regulation defines \"Multipiece package means a package containing two or more individually packaged or labelled pieces of the same commodity of identical quantity, intended for retail either in individual pieces or packages as a whole\" 9. Clause - 12 of the Regulation states Wholesale as follows: a) a number of retail packages, where such first mentioned package is intended for sale, distribution or delivery to an intermediary and is not intended for sale direct to a single consumer; or b) a commodity of food sold to an intermediary in bulk to enable such intermediary to sell, distribute or deliver such commodity of food https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page 6 of 11 \f W.P.No.30839 of 2015 to the consumer in smaller quantities\". 10. Clause 2.6 of the Regulation contemplates exemptions from labelling requirements- Clause 2.6.1(5) enumerates that \"In case of wholesale packages the particulars regarding list of ingredients, Date of Manufacture/ packing, best before, expiry date labelling of irradiated food and, vegetarian logo/ non vegetarian log, may not be specified.\" 11. The learned counsel for the petitioner made a submission that the packages in the case of the petitioner is wholesale package. The commercial invoice issued by the exporting company indicates that the Sodium Chloride (food grade) in 25 kg/PE bag (Polyethylene bags). Therefore, the salt is packed in 25 kgs baggage and is a wholesale package. When it is a wholesale package, the exemption clause has to be applied and therefore, the stand taken by the Department is not in consonance with the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page 7 of 11 \f W.P.No.30839 of 2015 provisions of the Regulation of the year 2011. 12. This Court is of the considered opinion that it is not in dispute that the petitioner imported salt from China. Further, the invoice indicates that it is a wholesale package. As far as the wholesale package of salt is concerned, the exemption clause is applicable. Furthermore, it is brought to the notice of this Court that there is no expiry date for salt. These are all the facts which were not considered by the competent authorities. Thus, this Court is inclined to consider the Writ Petition. 13. Accordingly, the respondents 3 and 4 are directed to draw samples and certify petitioner's standard based on the specification applicable under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The said exercise is directed to be done within a period of 4 weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. 14.

        "    {'text': \"\"\"JUDGMENT 1. This is an application purporting to be under Section 151, Civil P.C. in First Appeal No. 358 of 1925. The prayer in this application is to be found in para. 8 which runs as follows: That considering that the judgment was not delivered for a considerably long time after the hearing of the argument and that it was possible to miss important points advanced in argument and considering the technical defect in delivery of judgment which makes it a nullity, it is prayed that the case may be treated as undecided and may be re-heard or in the alternative if the judgment may be considered to be a legal judgment it may be revised. 2. This application is signed by a counsel who did not appear in the case, and Mr. K.D. Malaviya on behalf of Mr. Muhammad Husain asked us to postpone the hearing as Mr. Muhammad Husain was not in Court. We did not consider that a sufficient reason for postponing the hearing when the counsel must have known that this Bench was constituted specially to hear the application today. 3. The points urged by Mr. Malaviya are that the judgment of this Court was not properly signed and delivered, because according to him on 8th August 1928, the complete judgment was not read out in Court and was not signed by either of us on that date, that under Order 41, Rule 31, Civil P.C., every judgment of this Court in appeal had to be in writing and had to be signed when it was pronounced and the Judges had to date it. He further submits that under Ch. 7, Rule 3 of the Rules of the High Court when a written judgment is delivered in an appeal it had first to be signed by the Judges who heard the case and only then could be pronounced by one of such Judges. It is urged by Mr. Malaviya that the non-compliance of the rules in view of the affidavit filed by his client makes the judgment a nullity, and therefore the case must be treated as not disposed of and an undecided case, and therefore he prays that his client should be given an opportunity of re-arguing the case before this Bench. 4. An application was presented to Dalal, J., who was the vacation Judge on 14th August 1928 supported by an affidavit that the judgment had not been signed by us and that there was no judgment in the office of the High Court. Dalal, J., directed this application to be land before one of us with an office report on the points raised in the application. The office has submitted a report which is dated 14th December 1928. 5. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru who appears on behalf of the opposite party, viz. the appellant in the case, submits that Order 41, Rule 31 and Order 20 and the rules thereunder do not apply to the Chartered High Courts when the rules relating to judgments were in force when the Civil Procedure Code was enacted. He has referred to Order 49, Rule 2, and we accept his contention that in view of the fact that before the present Code was enacted the rules were in force, viz., the rules of Court of 18th January 1898, the provisions of Order 20 and that of Order 41, Rule 31 do not apply to the High Court. He has further submitted that if the Judges had agreed to a judgment under the rules of the Court it was not necessary that the judgment should be signed by both the Judges before pronouncing the judgment. It is necessary to state exactly what happened in the case. The appeal was argued by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru on behalf of the appellant and by Mr. O'Conor and Dr. Katju on behalf of the respondent. The hearing lasted several days and at the conclusion of the hearing we reserved our judgment. Thereafter we met in chambers several times, discussed the points that had to be decided, discussed the value to be attached to the evidence called, both oral and documentary, and we agreed to what the decision on such point raised in the case was to be. There were really three points in the case. The first question was as to whether the plaintiff had proved the pedigree he had set forward, the second was whether the defendant had proved his adoption, and the third point was whether Bhagwan Das and Hira Lal were members of a joint Hindu family. As one of us proceeded on casual leave there was delay in writing out the judgment and on the 8th August the Court sat for the last time before the long vacation. By a mistake of the office the case was listed in Court No. 5 and was by an order transferred to Court No. 1. The judgment on the first question had been typed out and contained the result of the joint consultation between us. On the 8th August, the note made by the officer of the Court whose duty is to record proceedings was as follows: Judgment delivered today: parties present: appeal allowed: judgment with Hon'ble Banerji, 6. Orally it was stated in open Court, what was our finding on the two other points that we had to decide, but the reasons for the decision of the second and third point had not been recorded. The complete judgment was signed by one of us and then sent to the other for signature, but on account of his absence from the station on duty the judgment was not sent into the office until 22nd August 1928 duly signed by both of us. 7. It thus appears that although one of us had pronounced in open Court the joint findings arrived at by us, the record of our reasons was not in Court on 8th August 1928, and the judgment had not been duly signed by both of us on that date. 8. Rule 3, Ch. 7, of rules of the Court, in our opinion, requires that when a written judgment is pronounced by one of the Judges it has to be signed by both the Judges but this, in our opinion, is a mere irregularity and does not in any way affect the merits and in our opinion Section 151, Civil P.C., cannot be invoked to ask us to re-hear the case merely on account of a technical irregularity. 9. The 8th August 1928, being the last date of sittings the office could not arrange that both of us should be sitting together to deliver the judgment orally. It was for the convenience of counsel that in case the parties wanted to appeal to His Majesty in Council that we pronounced our judgment on the 8th to enable counsel to prepare the application for leave to appeal at leisure. Although Mr. Malaviya suggests that the judgment would not be illegal if we had the last page copied out and we signed the last page and then pronounced the judgment, it appears to us that no useful purpose would be served by adopting that course. There is no force in this application, and we dismiss it with costs. We assess counsel's fees for today's hearing at Rs. 200.\"\"\", 'category': 1},\n",

It was also stated in Ext.P13 that, if the petitioner is aggrieved in any manner, he could very well approach the 4th respondent/appellate authority in this regard. Petitioner has approached this Court, challenging the inaction on the part of the 4th respondent, despite preferring Ext.P14 appeal in this regard. 3. A statement has been filed from the part of the first respondent seeking to sustain the stand taken by the department, also pointing out \f WP (C) No. 15688 of 2008 : 2 : in paragraph 11 that, the appeal preferred by the petitioner has already been considered and disposed of, and that the petitioner was conveyed to the petitioner through Ext.R1(A) dated 1.8.2007. A copy of the minutes of the Committee dated 19.9.2006 is also produced and marked as Ext.R1(B). It is contended that the petitioner does not have any legal right to claim the reward as a matter of right, as per the law declared by Apex Court, as well as by this Court on the point. 4. It is true that the legal position as above cannot be in dispute any further. But the point involved is whether Ext.P14 appeal preferred by the petitioner has been considered and disposed of in accordance with the 'guidelines' as offered and stipulated vide Ext.P13 reply. 5. Ext. R1(A) intimation conveyed to the petitioner shows that it was only with reference to the letter dated 29.6.2007 of the 4th respondent; whereas Ext.R1(B) attached along with it, is dated 19.6.2006. That apart, Ext.R1(B) shows that, it is in respect of the proceedings granting \"final award\" pursuant to the proposal submitted by the Director of Income Tax (Inv.), Kochi and not with reference to Ext.P14 appeal preferred by the petitioner. Besides this, no opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner before finalizing Ext.P14. 6. After hearing both the sides, this Court finds that, Ext.P14 has to be reconsidered by the fourth respondent with reference to the \f WP (C) No. 15688 of 2008 : 3 : relevant 'guidelines' and also with regard to the actual facts and figures. Accordingly, the Writ Petition is disposed of, directing 4th respondent to reconsider Ext.P14 appeal preferred by the petitioner, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within a period of 3 months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. Disposed of as above. P. R. RAMACHANDRA MENON, JUDGE kmd\"\"\", 'category': 1},\n",
